#Data Structures:
# the way store and organize the data so that it can be accesse  effectively
# example of DICTIONARY LIBRARY
#in python  Programming Language we are divided into two categoery
# 1. Built_In :List, Tuple ,Set,DICTIONARY
# 2. User_Defined : stack,queue,linked_list,tree and graph


# 1. Built_In :List, Tuple ,Set,DICTIONARY
# !.List: list is store the sequence of data in data structure
# example : list1=[1,2,3,4,5]
list=[1,2,3,4,5]
print(list)
list1=[1,1.2,"subodh"]
#the list are store the data as the index this example lista[0]=1,list1[1]=1.2 and list1[2]='subodh'
print(list1[0])
print(list1[1])
print(list1[2])
# you can access list element using index example over here
#the list start the 0 index

#list have nested properties are follow
#exmple here
list2=[[1,2,3],[1.2,1.3,1.4],["subodh","shrestha","nepal"],1,2,3]
print(list2[0])
print(list2[1])
print(list2[2])
print(list2[3])


# list are mutable in nature
# the list can be added list can be modified and list can be deleted as the its method
# example of add in list
list2.append(4)# the append keyword the  value are added in the list1


# list are deleted as the method of deleted
del list2[0]

# the list value modified or update or edit
list2[2]="hello i am list"
# notes: mutable means the value of data are  modifid  or change is call mutable data types ofr data Structures
# list are dynamic

# about the list in highlight
#list are mutable
# list are dynamic
# list can store the data group of data in sequence
